CSE 601 - Data Mining and Bioinformatics - PA1

## Part 1 - Dimentionality Reduction
PCA based dimensionality reduction applied on three biomedical data files (pca_a.txt, pca_b.txt, pca_c.txt)
In each file, each row is the health record of a patient/sample; the last column is the disease name, and rest of the columns are features.
